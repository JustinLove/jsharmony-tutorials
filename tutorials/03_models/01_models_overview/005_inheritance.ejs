<h3>What is inheritance</h3>
Inheritance enables the developer to create a new model based on the design of another model, with changes such as:
<ul>
  <li>Different actions (Browse vs Update forms)</li>
  <li>Additional or fewer fields</li>
  <li>Different table datasource</li>
  <li>Different styles or menu</li>
  <li>Different buttons</li>
</ul>
By reducing repeated code, inheritance results in:
<ul>
  <li>Faster development</li>
  <li>Fewer bugs</li>
  <li>Easier-to-maintain systems</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to implement inheritance</h3>
Starting with a basic grid of contacts:
<pre>
"CustContact_Listing_Basic": {
  "table":"v_cust_contact",
  "layout":"grid",
  "title":"All Contacts",
  "actions":"B", 
  "sort":["^cust_contact_name"], 
  "menu":"clients",
  "fields":[
    {"name":"cust_contact_id","type":"bigint","actions":"B","key":1,"caption": "ID"},
    {"name":"cust_contact_name","type":"varchar","length":"50","caption": "Contact","actions":"B"},
    {"name":"cust_name","type":"varchar","length":"50","caption": "Customer","actions":"B"}
  ]
}
</pre>
<%-getScreenshot('jsHarmonyTutorials/CustContact_Listing_Basic?popup=1','Inheritance - Contact Listing')%>
A developer may want to create another grid, based on that grid, but with the customer name replaced by the contact title:
<pre>
"CustContact_Listing_Inherited": {
  "inherits": "CustContact_Listing_Basic",
  "fields":[
    {"name":"cust_contact_title","type":"varchar","length":"8","caption": "Title","actions":"B","__AFTER__":"cust_contact_name"},
    {"name":"cust_name","__REMOVE__":1}
  ]
}
</pre>

<h3>Inheritance Syntax</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>"inherits": "MODEL NAME"</b><br/>
    The inherits parameter references the parent model.  All properties of the parent model will be copied to the child model.  It's important to note, any JavaScript that embeds the parent model name will not be changed.  In the example above, if there was a JavaScript class "CustContact_Listing_Basic", it would still be called "CustContact_Listing_Basic" in the child model.  It should not cause problems, however it is recommended to use a different shared base class name in this situation for code readability.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>"key": "__REMOVEPROPERTY__"</b><br/>
    The __REMOVEPROPERTY__ value can be used to remove top-level parent model properties from child models.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>"__REMOVE__": true</b><br/>
    The __REMOVE__ key can be used to remove an entire object.  For example, Fields, Tabs, and Buttons can be removed from inherited models.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>"__REMOVEALL__": true</b><br/>
    The __REMOVEALL__ key can be used to remove this object, any objects defined prior to this object, any objects inherited from a parent model.  For example, Fields, Tabs, and Buttons can be removed from inherited models.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>"__AFTER__": "FIELDNAME"</b><br/>
    <b>"__AFTER__": "__START__"</b><br/>
    <b>"__AFTER__": "__END__"</b><br/>
    The __AFTER__ parameter can be used to change the sort position of fields, tabs, and buttons.  Setting __AFTER__ to the fieldname will position the new field after the target field.  Setting __AFTER__ to __START__ or __END__ will position the field at the beginning or end of the model.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Inheritance Behavior by Property</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>model.groups</b> - Child model groups are added to the parent model groups.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.fields</b> - Child fields are added to the array of parent fields.  Fields can be removed using "__REMOVE__" / "__REMOVEALL__" and reordered using "__AFTER__".  Parent field properties can be overridden per-field, when the child field has the same name as the parent.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.fields.roles</b> - Field roles are merged
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.fields.validate</b> - Field validation is replaced
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.fields.*</b> - All other field properties are merged
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.tabs</b> - Child model tabs are added to existing parent tabs.  Tabs can be removed using "__REMOVE__" / "__REMOVEALL__" and reordered using "__AFTER__".  Parent model tab properties can be overridden per-tab, when the child model's tab has the same name as the parent.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.tabs.*</b> - All tab properties are merged
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.buttons</b> - Child model buttons are added to existing parent buttons.  Buttons can be removed using "__REMOVE__" / "__REMOVEALL__" and reordered using "__AFTER__".  Parent model button properties can be overridden per-button, when the child model's button has the same name as the parent.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.buttons.*</b> - All button properties are merged
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.roles</b> - Model roles are replaced
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.js</b> - Child model javascript code will be appended to the parent model's javascript code
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.ejs</b> - Child model EJS code will be appended to the parent model's EJS code
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.css</b> - Child model css will be appended to the parent model's css
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.pagesettings</b> - Report page settings are merged
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.reportdata</b> - Report queries will be merged at the top level (_.extend)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.fonts</b> - Child report fonts will be concatenated to the parent report fonts
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>model.*</b> - Other properties will be replaced
  </li>
</ul>
