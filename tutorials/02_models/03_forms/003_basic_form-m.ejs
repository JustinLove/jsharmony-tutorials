<h3>Overview</h3>
The "form-m" layout provides an interface to update multiple records in one save operation.  This layout is primarily used as a subform to edit a parent/child relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Navigation buttons are displayed for paging between records.  No data is saved until the "Save" button is pressed.

<pre>
{
  "table":"ca",
  "layout":"form-m",
  "onecolumn":true,
  "caption":["Address","Addresses"],
  "fields":[
    {"name":"c_id","control":"hidden"},
    {"name":"ca_country","caption":"Country"},
    {"name":"ca_addr1","caption":"Address"},
    {"name":"ca_addr2","caption":""},
    {"name":"ca_city","caption":"City"},
    {"name":"ca_state","caption":"State"},
    {"name":"ca_zip","caption":"Zip"}
  ]
}
</pre>

<h3>Canonical Syntax</h3>
The form-m should have at least a primary key.  In most instances, it should also have a foreign key for use in parent/child bindings:
<pre>
{
  "table":"ca",
  "layout":"form-m",
  "onecolumn":true,
  "caption":["Address","Addresses"],
  "fields":[
    {"name":"ca_id","key": 1,"control":"hidden"},
    {"name":"c_id","actions":"I","foreignkey": 1,"control":"hidden"},
    {"name":"ca_country","caption":"Country"},
    {"name":"ca_addr1","caption":"Address"},
    {"name":"ca_addr2","caption":""},
    {"name":"ca_city","caption":"City"},
    {"name":"ca_state","caption":"State"},
    {"name":"ca_zip","caption":"Zip"}
  ]
}
