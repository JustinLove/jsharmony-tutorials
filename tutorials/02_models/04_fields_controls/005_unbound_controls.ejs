No type = not in SQL statements / not sent to server?
Unbound = No control color changed on "updated"
          Not part of HasUpdate
          Not part of Params sent to Server
          No server-side validators
          Not returned in xmodel.hasBindingOrRootKey, unless in xmodel.bindings
          Saved temporarily client-side when switching rows in form-m / grid
          No sort enabled in grid
          always_editable = field does not become read-only (based on field.action or field.readonly).  Yes on field.controlparams.base_readonly
                 Field Validators run based on model actions, not on field actions
                 * Can only be used with unbound controls
