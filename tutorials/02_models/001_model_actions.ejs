<h3>Introduction</h3>
Permissions ensure that users can't access restricted data, and can only change data that they have access to in the system.<br/>
<br/>
The <b>"actions"</b> property defines whether the model can be used for <b>BIUD</b> - Browse, Insert, Update, or Delete.<br/>
<br/>
The <b>"roles"</b> property further restricts the capabilities of the model per user.

<h3>Actions / Roles</h3>
<pre>
{
  "table":"c",
  "layout":"grid",
  "title":"All Customers",
  "caption":[0,"Customer","Customers"],
  "actions":"BI",
  "roles": {"C_B":"B","C_X":"*"}
}
</pre>
The <b>"actions"</b> parameter defines what operations the model can perform.  Actions can be any combination of the following characters.
<ul>
  <li><b>B</b> - Browse</li>
  <li><b>I</b> - Insert</li>
  <li><b>U</b> - Update</li>
  <li><b>D</b> - Delete</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The "roles" parameter is used to restrict actions by user role.  Roles can be defined as follows:
<ul>
  <li><b>B</b> - Browse</li>
  <li><b>I</b> - Insert</li>
  <li><b>U</b> - Update</li>
  <li><b>D</b> - Delete</li>
  <li><b>*</b> - All roles - equivalent to BIUD</li>
</ul>
By default, only the SYSADMIN and DEV roles have access to a model.  Permissions for users who are not SYSADMINs or DEVs must be explicity defined using the "role" parameter.<br/>
<br/>
From a technical perspective, effective permissions are computed by intersecting the model's "actions" parameter with a union of each applicable "role".  For example:
<pre>
"actions":"BIUD",
"roles":{ 
  "SYSADMIN":"*",
  "EDIT":"BU",
  "READONLY":"B" 
}
</pre>
<b>=> Will result in the following permissions:</b><br/>
A user with only the "READONLY" role will have <b>"B"</b> access<br/>
A user with both the "EDIT" and "READONLY" roles will have <b>"BU"</b> access<br/>
A user with both the "SYSADMIN", "EDIT" and "READONLY" roles will have <b>"BIUD"</b> access
